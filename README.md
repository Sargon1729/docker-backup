# docker-backup
Painless way to backup docker containers on remote hosts

Simply copy and rename the `config.example.sh` to `config.sh` and provide the required variables.

Do the same for `compose-files.txt`, place the full path for the compose files, one on each line, and comment out the ones you want to start back up after the backup is complete.
